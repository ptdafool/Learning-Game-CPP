A BIG shoutout to this man.  He is knowledgable, and his tutorials go in depth.  I'd recommend not doing what I did and diving right into the deep end with the hardware 3D series without going through the previous series on 3D fundamentals, and having at least some intermediate knowledge of C++.  You will struggle if you do.
