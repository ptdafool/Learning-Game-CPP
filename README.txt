This project was built by PtDaFool using code provided by YouTuber 'ChilliTomatoNoodle'.  Full credit is hereby given to his code used to develop this project.

A BIG shoutout to this man.  He is knowledgable, and his tutorials go in depth.  I'd recommend not doing what I did and diving right into the deep end with the hardware 3D series without going through the previous series on 3D fundamentals, and having at least some intermediate knowledge of C++.  You will struggle if you do.

Legal stuff - basically, I am indemnifying myself and the original developer from any damages whatsoever, so if you download Chilli's software, or 'mine' (I say this as there are only minor changes to what is essentially his code at this point.  It's a learning exercise for me, so yeah I have changed some parts to my name but full credit for the code still goes to the man who produced it!)

This software is provided 'as is' with absolutely no warranty whatsoever either express or implied.

Neither myself, nor Chilli will be held responsible in any way, shape or form for anything that happens as a result of the use of this software either compiled, or from the source code.

IF YOU DOWNLOAD AND USE THIS SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL MYSELF OR CHILLI BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT POINT.

Full credit for the original source code goes to the original developer 'ChilliTomatoNoodle'.  His Channel is available here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsyHonfwHi4fLb2lkq0DEAA
